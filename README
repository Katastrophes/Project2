Project 2

We are working on team 3’s music site. The following are their specific requests:

    “1. Design is cleaner and more intuitive
    2. We want the slide show to be cooler and have a modern feel
    3. More iconography and aesthetically pleasing graphics”

We are also going to be making these additional improvements:
  Integrate videos into the pages for more media content.
  Increase use of hyperlinks throughout the pages to display additional information.
  Image reveal to improve load time and save memory.
  Make responsive nav bar / hamburger menu with music player built into it.
